[The CWC Commuter](https://github.com/G0WCZ/cwc)

A little box that you can plug a key and headphones into. It Wifi connects to your phone hotspot. It has a channel selector. Dial up a channel and tx/rx CW on that channel. That's it.

This is an internet transceiver for CW that you can take with you. It aims to be more like a radio than a computer.

[Keyrama](http://www.cq-cq.eu/DJ5IL_rt008.pdf)

Enables you to get a wide view of the different keying modes, to
compare their proper logic and accurate timing with
the logic and timing of other keyers

[YACK - Yet an other CW Keyer](https://yack.sourceforge.net/) [Source Files](https://sourceforge.net/projects/yack/files/)

YACK is a universal CW keyer library and application for the AVR architecture.

This is a tiny, cheap, and open source CW keyer. (ATtiny*5)

[IambicKeyer](https://github.com/WyomingGeezer/IambicKeyer)

This is an iambic keyer based upon the Arduino UNO platform. It provides a means to generate audio sidetone for the purpose of implementing modulated FM that can be used on 2M repeaters.

[PiCW - JamesP6000](https://github.com/JamesP6000/PiCW)

Raspberry Pi bareback LF/MF/HF/VHF CW (Morse code) transmitter

Makes a very simple Morse Code transmitter from your RasberryPi by connecting
GPIO port 4 to Antenna (and LPF). Operates on LF, MF, HF and VHF bands from 0
to 250 MHz.

Compatible with the original Raspberry Pi, the Raspberry Pi 2/3, and
the Pi Zero.

[The-5-kiB](https://github.com/pp5vx/The-5-kiB)

This is an "Accu-Keyer" (WB4VVF) Clone for the Arduino (or ATTiny45 or 85)

[arduino-cw-key](https://github.com/shyamajp/arduino-cw-key)

Joystick becomes a CW key.

[Digi-Keyer](https://www.digikey.com/en/blog/updating-the-original-digi-keyer)

A reboot of the original DigiKeyer.
