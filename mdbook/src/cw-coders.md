# CW Coders
-----

*A group dedicated to the scientific exploration and open development of
Interrupted Continuous Wave and Morse Code Telegraphy.*

-----

As a community we explore the computer science, electrical, electronic and radio-frequency
engineering concepts covering all aspects of CW equipment and operation.

The practice of CW operation is a deceptively complicated area that offers much
to explore.  On the surface it seems rather straight foward.  Morse Code is
perhaps the simplest method of encoding language and the single-frequency
interrupted carrier-wave is the simplest of rf transmission modes.
Together these two simple concepts significanly constrain the core requirements.

However, once solutions start to involve electronic keyers and microcontroller /
computer software the domain rapidly expands to include many of the most
interesting and challenging aspects of Human/Computer interaction.  The
real-time nature of events and the coupling of both input and output elements
result in requirements that are usually only required by electronic musical
instruments.  Not even modern video game controllers require the time-domain
resolution that our devices require.

As with all aspects of engineering and highly-technical applications there is an
abundance of different methodologies and solutions available.  This is
especially true when it comes to learning methods.  In our group we respect all
attemtps to solve the challenging problems we face.  We'll strive to catpure any
relevant resources and approach our catalogging and discussion all existing and
emerging solutions without bias.  Innovation and experimentation is especially
encouraged.
